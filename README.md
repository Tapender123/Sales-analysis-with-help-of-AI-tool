What's This About?

his project contains a sales data analysis report for Dream Big Company, based on 9,994 sales orders from the United States. The report dives into sales trends, profits, discounts, customer segments, and more to help understand how the business is performing. The specialty of this project is that all tasks—data cleaning, data processing, report preparation, and PowerPoint presentation creation—were performed entirely using AI tools.
Tools Used
 Charts like boxplots were used to visualize sales data. No specific code is included here, but you can recreate similar analyses with common data tools and AI assistance.
Tools used : AI + Power Point(without AI only to ease the language for final presentation so that non tech can also understand the report easily)
